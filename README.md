# perspective_of_oreos
Core lab Multiple Perspectives assignment due 9/25/2022.
this is a website about different perspectives of an Oreo.
It talks about how people eat Oreos in different ways. 
Same Oreo, different arrangements, different formations.
It can also be seen as a metaphore of how people view different things. 
The sequence of doing things matters.
